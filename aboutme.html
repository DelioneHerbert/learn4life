  <h1>A few things about me</h1>
  <p class="ip">im an aspiring video game developer who is loud, to the point, and a bit random. im incredible hyperactive but work hard when i have to, i also love telling jok<a class="secret" href="secret.html">e</a>s and making those around me laugh as much as possible. while i do know how to make websites my primary passion is video game development. at the time of writting i am 18, a few months away from finishing highschool. i hope to learn a new languge (coding wize) so i can start making my own video games soon. i hope youve enjoyed your time on this website that maybe 4 people might look at, by the way there is a secret hidden on the page. can you find it without looking at the code? we will see. </p>
  <h3>SHHHHH!</h3>
